    <!-- In this lecture we talk about Form Input tags.......... -->
    <!-- <form> is an HTML element to collect input data containing interactive controls. It provides facilities to input text, number, values, email, password, and control fields such as checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc., or in other words, form is a container that contains input elements like text, email, number, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, etc. Forms are generally used when you want to collect data from the user. For example, a user wants to buy a bag online, so he/she has to first enter their shipping address in the address form and then add their payment details in the payment form to place an order.
        Forms are created by placing input fields within paragraphs, preformatted text, lists and tables. This gives considerable flexibility in designing the layout of forms.  
        Syntax:
        <form>
            <!--form elements-->
      <!-- </form>
      Form elements
These are the following HTML <form> elements:
<label>: It defines label for <form> elements.

Textbox in HTML Form
In an HTML form, we use the <input> tag by assigning type attribute value to text to input single line input. To define type attribute see the below syntax. 
Tip: The default value of the type attribute is “text”.

Syntax:
<input type="text" />
Or shorthand for “text” type:
<input />
Password in an HTML Form
We can change the type value text to password to get the input password 
Example: This example shows the type password in html form.
HTML --> 
    <form>
        <p>
            <label>Username : <input type="text" /></label>
        </p>
        <p>
            <label>Password : <input type="password" /></label>
        </p> 
        <p>
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
        </p>
    </form>


    The <input> tag specifies an input field where the user can enter data.

The <input> element is the most important form element.

The <input> element can be displayed in several ways, depending on the type attribute.

The different input types are as follows:

<input type="button">
<input type="checkbox">
<input type="color">
<input type="date">
<input type="datetime-local">
<input type="email">
<input type="file">
